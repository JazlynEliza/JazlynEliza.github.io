	<h1><center>The Reason Behind my Decision</center><h/1>
	
	<p><center>Many people assume I chose to attend University of Maine because that's where the rest of my family went, however it was so much more than that. I grew up saying I wouldn't attend UMaine-I was going to be the one who branched out and did something different, but after seeing other schools I constantly found myself comparing the others to back to the Orono campus. I realized this was a sign. Now, months later, I couldn't be happier with my decision. The university has offered me so much. Not only did I receive a discounted education as a reward for my hard work in high school, but I also found many amazing friends and a home away from home in the sorority Pi Beta Phi. I'm so excited about my future here and the opportunities to learn and socialize. </center></p>
